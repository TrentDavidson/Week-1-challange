# Code Refactor Starter Code

The things I changed in this weeks challange

The things I changed in this weeks challange include adding coments to the css page and condensing the code so it wasn,t repeating.
I also Fixed the nav bar so when you clicked on it, it accually works and changed some of the divs to sections. I did this to provide different sections and not have the page be cluttered with divs.
